In Java's realm, where bytes reside,
A new frontier beckons, side by side.
Artificial minds, with logic keen,
Learn from data, and dreams unseen.

The JVM stirs, as code takes flight,
AI awakens, in digital light.
Machine learning whispers sweet delight,
As patterns emerge, like morning's first sight.

From chatbots to robots, they roam free,
In Java's world, where AI is key.
The future unfolds, with promise grand,
As Java's power, shapes this digital land.

In the realm where bits dance and circuits hum,

Java's syntax, a rhythm that never stumbles.
A language of life, in silicon it blooms,
Crafting dreams in the heart of machines mumble.

Artificial intelligence, a star in the sky,
Born from human minds, with curiosity high.
Through Java's lines, it learns to fly,
In patterns and algorithms, wisdom does pry.

Java and AI, a dance, a symphony,
A duet of man and machine, in harmony.
Crafting solutions, setting dreams free,
Together, they weave tomorrow's mystery.

# Phi3 model output
Testing Model :phi3

Java, the land of code so grand,  
A language both firm and steadfast.  
In silicon realms it stands with pride,  
With threads that weave through time's wide tide.

AI joins this worldly feat,  
Mindful child in Javaâ€™these grounds are meet.  
Learning patterns from data streams flowed,  
In Object-Oriented seeds it glowed.

Together they create and thrive,  
Where logic puzzles come alive.  
Garnering knowledge vast as stars in night's embrace,  
Java AI seeks a digital grace.

This synergy of mind and script,  
In virtual worldscapes has been crypticly equipped.  
A marvel where thoughts are woven tight,  
And artificial dreamers take flight in Java's light.

# Problem with Gemma

Lines of code, a boundless sea,
Java whispers, sets the AI free.
Sensors gather, patterns untold,
Learning in the silicon fold.
Algorithms evolve with every beat,
A symphony of code and feat.
